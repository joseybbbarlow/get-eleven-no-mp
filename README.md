## 🎮 How It Works (Just Like Webkinz)

### Objective:
Clear all cards from the pyramid by making groups that sum to 11

### Gameplay:
1. **Click cards** that add up to 11
2. **They auto-remove** when sum = 11
3. **Draw from deck** adds cards BACK to pyramid
4. **Clear 5 groups without drawing** = Bonus card!
5. **Bonus cards** appear on the right side
6. **Use bonus cards** anytime to help reach 11
7. **Beat the timer** to advance to next level!

### Level Progression:
- **Level 1:** 148 seconds
- **Level 2:** 140 seconds  
- **Level 3:** 132 seconds
- Each level: -8 seconds
- **Minimum:** 60 seconds

### Bonus Cards:
- Earn by clearing 5 groups in a row WITHOUT drawing
- Random card value (1-10)
- Appears in BONUS panel on right
- Click to select, combine with pyramid cards
- **DISAPPEARS at end of each level!** (use it or lose it!)
- Can stack multiple bonus cards in one level
- Use multiple cards in one grouping

### Card Values:
- **Ace = 1**
- **2 through 10 = Face value**
- **NO Jack/11** - just 1-10!

## 💡 Pro Tips (Same as Webkinz)

### Earning Bonus Cards:
1. Clear 5 groups in a row
2. Do NOT draw from deck during those 5
3. You'll hear... well, you'll see a notification!
4. Bonus card appears on right

### Strategy:
- Memorize pairs: 1+10, 2+9, 3+8, 4+7, 5+6
- Clear from top to expose more cards
- Save bonus cards for tough spots
- Don't look at timer - focus on cards!
- Drawing adds cards back - use sparingly!

### Level Progression:
- Each level gives less time
- Bonus cards carry over!
- Try to save bonus cards for harder levels
- Game gets faster - stay focused!

## 🐛 Game Ends When:

1. ⏰ **Time runs out**
2. ❌ **No valid moves left** (auto-detected!)
3. 🎉 **You clear the board** (advance to next level!)

No more waiting for timer when stuck!

## 📊 Scoring

- **10 points** per card in a valid group
- **2 cards** = 20 points
- **3 cards** = 30 points
- **4 cards** = 40 points (with bonus card!)

Bigger groups = More points!
